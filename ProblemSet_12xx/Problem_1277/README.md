### âœ… Intuition

The number of squares ending at an index (i, j) is the size of the largest square ending at that index.

There is a property here, a square of size `n` ending at index (i, j) is only possible if there exists squares of size `n-1` ending at (i-1, j), (i, j-1) and (i-1, j-1). Using this property, we can build a dynamic programming algorithm to get the size of the largest square ending at each index.

The result will be the sum of the sizes at the indices.
