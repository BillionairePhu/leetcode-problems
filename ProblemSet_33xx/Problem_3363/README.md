### âœ… Intuition

Although labeled as a Hard problem, this is indeed very easy. You just need to realize that the path for 3 kids are in fact not crossed, each of them has a separate area they can walk.

> This happens because each kid can only take n-1 steps, they only have just enough step to reach the destination - not extra to wander around.

The first kid has one single path to walk (1,1) -> (2,2) -> ... -> (n-1,n-1)

The second and third kid cannot cross the first kid's path.

Therefore, we just straightforward calculate the maximum candies each kid can collect and take the sum of them.
