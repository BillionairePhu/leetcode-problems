# Leetcode Problem 149

Given an array of `points` where `points[i] = [xi, yi]` represents a point on the **X-Y** plane, return the maximum number of points that lie on the same straight line.

Constraints:
- 1 <= points.length <= 300
- points[i].length == 2
- -104 <= xi, yi <= 104
- All the points are unique.


## âœ… Solution Strategy

Loop over every two points

## ðŸ§ª Complexity

- **Time:** O($points.length^3$)
- **Space:** O($points.length$)
