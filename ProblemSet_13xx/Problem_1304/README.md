### âœ… Intuition

Just append each pair of opposite-sign numbers so that the total sum is 0. But remember that the numbers need to be unique so you cannot use the same number twice => the easy easiest way is to increment the number being used.

If `n` is odd -> then there is a number not having the opposite-sign number => just use 0
