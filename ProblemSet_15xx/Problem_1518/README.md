# ðŸ”¥ Leetcode Problem (1518)

> **Problem:** [Water Bottles](https://leetcode.com/problems/water-bottles/)<br />
> **Difficulty:** Easy<br/>
> **Tags:** `Math`, `Simulation`

---

### âœ… Intuition

Pretty straightforward. Just simulate the problem using code => repeating the step of drinking and exchanging bottle (use some variables to keep track of the number of bottles at each step).

We don't need to optimize this since the problem is already very fast.

### ðŸ§ª Complexity

With `n` being the number of original bottles `numBottles`

- **Time:** O(log(n))
- **Space:** O(n)
