### âœ… Intuition

For this problem, there are 2 approaches to solve it:

#### O(n^2) approach - simplest

Just simulate the problem as described by the challenge. You will iteratively generate new array of numbers by adding 2 consecutive numbers in the original array. Repeat this step until there is only 1 element left.

#### O(n) approach - Newton's binomial theorem

You can then easily come up with this formula 

$ans= âˆ‘_{i=0}^{nâˆ’1} C_i^{nâˆ’1}nums[i](mod10)$
