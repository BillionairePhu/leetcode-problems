### âœ… Intuition

To simplify the problem description: find minimum `t` such that with that `t`, we can go from the starting point `(0,0)` to the right corner `(m-1, n-1)`.

In other word, at time `t`, any cells that has the level value less than or equal to `t` is submerged and we can travel between any adjacent submerged cells => we need to expand from the starting cell to the right corner cell.

The trick here is very simple: we slowly increase the level of water `t` and put expanding cell-candidates into a small-heap. If the cell is submerged, we will add the neighboring cells into the heap. 

If the considered cell is the right corner cell, we break the loop and return the `t` value.

Repeat this step until the lowest-level cell is no longer submerged. Only then that we increase `t` and then repeat the step.
