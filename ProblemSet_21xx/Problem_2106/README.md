### âœ… Intuition

The indices that one could travel from `startPos` would be in the range [`startPos - k`, `startPos + k`].

The idea here is that we would go from `startPos` toward index `i` in the range mentioned above and after hitting `i`, turn around and go in the other direction with the remaining steps.
