### âœ… Intuition

Iterate through the powers of 2 to find out which numbers will add up to `n`. However, the trick here is to store only the power, not the whole number (e.g. 8 -> store 3 because 8 = 2^3). By doing this, we can keep the storing number small.

To get the multiplication of the query, we generate a prefix sum of the stored powers => each query only needs to calculate the power of the result
