## Repo features

**Leetcode folder generation**:

There is a python file `gen-leetcode.py` to automate the task of creating Leetcode folder along with default files.

```shell
Usage:
    python gen-leetcode.py [command] [arguments]

Commands:
    help                Show this help message.
    daily               Generate today's LeetCode daily challenge folder.
    classic <number>    Generate folder for a classic LeetCode problem by number.

Examples:
    python gen-leetcode.py daily
    python gen-leetcode.py classic 1234
```

*In the future, default files by programming language option will be added to this feature.*
