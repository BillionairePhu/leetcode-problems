### âœ… Intuition

Sort the potions ascendingly and now that we have a list sorted, we can use binary search to quickly find the index, from which all potions will create successful pair with the current spell.

### ðŸ§ª Complexity

Let n be number of spells and m be the number of potions.

- **Time:** $O(n*log(m) + m*log(m))$
- **Space:** $O(m + n)$
